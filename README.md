Introduction
----------------
-Include an introduction to your algorithm(s), summarizing the purpose of the algorithm and an overview of how it works.

-Algorithm description:

-Big O evaluation" section. This examines the time complexity of the algorithm. It should state the correct complexity and describe why the algorithm has that complexity.

-"Use cases" section this describes when this algorithm may be used.

-Edge cases and concerns" section this describes any constraints to using the algorithm or any situations where the algorithm will not yield the correct result.
